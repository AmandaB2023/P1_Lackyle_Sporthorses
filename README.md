### Features to Achieve Goals

*   The website will be built with a mobile-first approach, to ensure it is responsive. I will also test it on various devices and screen sizes.

*   General information about Lackyle Sables will be included on the Home page.

*   The Horses offered for sale will be presented on a page called For Sale. Each horse for sale will have a profile picture with a basic description. The user will then click on a button to obtain a more detailed description of each horse, which will include photos and videos.

*   A contact form asking for the user's contact details will be included on a separate contact page.


## Site Structure
The website is comprised of five pages, three of which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, for sale page & contact us page). The fourth page is a thank you page which is shown once a user submits the contact form on the contact page and the fifth page is a 404 page which will be shown if the user encounters an error on the site.

All pages will have:

* A responsive navigation bar. Which when viewed on larger screen sizes such as a laptop or desktop, will be at the top right side of the header. This allows the user to navigate through the site via page links to the home, for sale, and contact pages.

* On the left side of the header opposite the navigation elements, we have a logo for Lackyle Sporthorses which also acts as a link to the home page.

* On smaller screen sizes such as mobile phones or tablets to allow for a good user experience of the site, the Lackyle Sporthorses navigation menu text is hidden with a media query to prevent the navigation bar from being cluttered. 

* When viewing the site with mobile devices and/or tablets the navigation links change to a toggle menu with the use of a burger icon. This was implemented to give the site a clean and non-cluttered appearance, as well as to provide a good user experience. Given that most users would already be familiar with seeing and using the burger icon when navigating websites on mobile and other smaller-screen devices.

* A footer that contains links and icons for the four main social media platforms namely Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. 

* A location icon to show Lackyle Stables address, a phone icon to indicate Lackyle Stables phone number and an envelope icon that takes the user to the contact page. Icons were used to keep the footer clean because they are universally recognisable.

* A map image was also included to point users to Lackyle Stables location this image is static at the moment but it is intended to activate it going forward.

## Features

### Header

The header which includes a navigation menu is fixed to improve user experience. This way the user can easily navigate the website and click on another page from anywhere on the site.

*   Contains navigation menu links on the right side

### Navigation Menu

## Design

### Color Scheme
As Lackyle Stables already have their own colors, I worked these into the website. The background is mostly blue as the color blue can increase user engagement and conversion rates. The text on the blue background is white in order to make it stand out. This color combination is revered on buttons and a light grey is introduced for contrast. This is the same with the buttons and the hover element. While the social media icons transition to their signature colors when hovered over.

![Colors](documentation/colors.JPG)

### Typography

Merriweather was used for all the h1 elements while Montserrat was used for the other heading elements and the body text, with a back up of San Serif. These are two fonts I would be familiar with and felt they paired well together, as the website looked professional yet modern.

*   Merriweather

*   Montserrat

## Wireframes

The wireframes for the website were designed using Balsamiq. The designs vary from the end layout in some places due to creative decisions made throughout the development process.
