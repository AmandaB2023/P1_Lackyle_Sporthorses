## Validator Testing
 All the code for every page of the site has been run through The W3C HTML Markup Validation Service and the The W3C CSS Markup Validation Service to test the code for any errors. On the final tests i did have errors on my full advert discription pages , mainly due to the youtube video emed and the lack of a tile to a section whch did not require a title
