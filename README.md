## Wireframes
I created wireframes to visualize my ideas using Balsamiq. As I want to stick to the mobile-first approach I created wireframes for mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes.

## Site Structure
The website is comprised of five pages, three of which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, for sale page & contact us page). The fourth page is a thank you page which is shown once a user submits the contact form on the contact page and the fifth page is a 404 page which will be shown if the user encounters an error on the site.
